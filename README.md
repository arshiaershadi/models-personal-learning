- writing python code for developing LeNet and another custom convolutional network 

- to learn how to use custom estimators in tensorflow and to also do it with numpy matrix and array operations

- to learn the theory of convolutional neural networks:
      - the size matching of layers (input to output) and filters 
      - the rate of learning
      - training epochs
      - etc.
